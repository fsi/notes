# Links from 2020-11-06

- Music: [ΠΟΛΙΣ by Subheim](https://subheim.bandcamp.com/album/-), €9 digitally
- Also music: [Advent by Randal Collier-Ford](https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/advent), $7 digitally. It's a sci-fi dark ambient kind of album, if "cryochamber" label wasn't enough of a hint. I liked the cover (but stayed for the music).

# Links from 2020-11-27

- Music: [ΠΟΛΙΣ by Subheim](https://subheim.bandcamp.com/album/-), €9 digitally
- Also music: [Advent by Randal Collier-Ford](https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/advent), $7 digitally. It's a lovecraftian / dark scifi dark ambient kind of album, if "cryochamber" label wasn't enough of a hint. I liked the cover (but stayed for the music).
- Also also music: [Memory 417 by In Quantum](https://cryochamber.bandcamp.com/album/memory-417), also from cryo chamber. This one is mroe cyberpunk-ish.
- [@teeny tiny vinyl](https://www.instagram.com/teeny_tiny_vinyl/) dollhouse vinyl miniatures (not actually usable, just very cute) (TW: instagram)

- First off, hackernews brought me a link to [awfice](https://zserge.com/posts/awfice/) - a suite of minimal (read: one-liner data-url minimal) "office" tools. Text editor, presentations, quick drawing thingie and a spreadsheet (the spreadsheet being the most sketchy of four). [Also on github](http://github.com/zserge/awfice).
- From there, I was clicking around [sent](https://tools.suckless.org/sent/) â€” another minimal presentations tool, this time from suckless.org. I mostly know them for their dwm window manager, which is so small you're supposed to recompile it to change the config. Sent is also like that.
- Speaking of quick drawing thingies, [onthesamepage.online](https://onthesamepage.online/) is neat (also from that first link)

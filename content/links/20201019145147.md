# Links from 2020-10-25

- Brutalist [html.css](https://secretgeek.github.io/html_wysiwyg/html.html) to go with [markdown.css](https://mrcoles.com/demo/markdown-css/)
- [JS demo in 1021 bytes](http://www.p01.org/MONOSPACE/)
- [Internet of nothings](https://github.com/unusualcomputers/InternetOfNothings/blob/master/README.md) - a wifi hotspot for connecting "smart" "internet-of-things" devices to. It returns nothing for all (non-https) sites and thus "prevents harvesting and unauthorised use of your data by not being connected to anything else". Uses a single esp8266 board.
- [Encenathrakh - Thraakethraaeate Thraithraake](https://encenathrakh.bandcamp.com/album/thraakethraaeate-thraithraake) "chaotic death metal" or, like, free jazz with death metal instrumentation (it's all improvised, I think). Also, [this official lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVq5cKd5M5k).

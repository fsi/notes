# The Herring Gull's World

(This is a review of "The Herring Gull's World: A Study Of The Social Behaviour Of Birds" by Nikolaas Tinbergen)

Picked this book from a discout shelf on an impulse. Was not disappointed in the least.

It's always interesting to read the reports made by people captivated by the thing they're reporting about, and Mr Tinbergen is clearly captivated by animals and the intricacies of their behavior.

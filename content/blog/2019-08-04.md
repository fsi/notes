## Articles

- [LightSail2 is working!](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis/lightsail-2-successful-flight-by-light.html)

- [A nuclear war might make crops stop growing, so we need a backup plan.](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/7/25/20707644/nuclear-winter-famine-apocalypse-allfed)

  TL;DR: prepping for the apocalypse but _scientifically!_

  (Won't read the book because fuck elsevier, but it does sound interesting)

- [Why are the prices so damn high?](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/06/28/book-review-why-are-the-prices-so-damn-high/)

  Mostly linking it for this tangent that almost hurts to read:

  > The feeling is “subjective” in the sense that it occurs inside your mind, but it is “objective” in the sense that you cannot get it arbitrarily by wishing; some things produce it and some do not. For instance, it is a hell of a lot easier to feel loved by getting eye contact and a hug, than it is by typing words into a computer screen.

- [The Bakery that Runs on Emacs](https://bofh.org.uk/2019/02/25/baking-with-emacs/) (via [hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/03/06/the-bakery-that-runs-on-emacs/))

  TL;DR: OH GOD WHY (not that bad actually)

## Games

- Speaking of OH GOD WHY, [here's Diablo 1 ported to JS](https://diablo.rivsoft.net/) and running (a bit slowly on my laptop) in a browser window

## Music

- [Maggot Cave - Pub Full Of Maggots](https://maggotcave.bandcamp.com/)

  Grindcore from Sydney, Australia. 6 minutes and 52 seconds of angry loud nonsense, what's not to love.

  (Pay-what-you-want for the digital, $3+ for the CD)

- [Street Cleaner - Annihilation](https://streetcleaner.bandcamp.com/album/annihilation)

  And for something completely different, here's some outrun/synthwave from San Diego. Reminds me of a cd with demos and mod files that I had in the 90s

## Art

- [Bicycle seat with teeth](https://www.designboom.com/art/clem-chen-taxidermy-bike-seat-sculptures-03-04-2014/)

- [Pictures from Karabash](https://twitter.com/ktvsiy/status/1156898699903156224)

## Books

- Diamond Dogs by Alastair Reynolds.

  This is a part of compilation called "Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days" (and the second part is called Turquoise Days), two rather short novellas within the Revelation Space universe. While the "main sequence" revelation space books are hard sci-fi space opera kind of things, this one is small and more contained, and reminds me of [Rogue Moon by Algis Budrys](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_Moon). Which is not surprising, as Diamond Dogs itself references Rogue Moon.

## Life stuff

After this post expect a couple of weeks of hiatus, as I'll be spending my summer vatation in Czech Republic at Brutal Assault summer festival, and then at my parents' place.

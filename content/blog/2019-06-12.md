## Programming

- [On Dat://](https://www.kickscondor.com/on-dat/)

  TL;DR: Dat is a distributed web network, and this post talks about building a clone of an old (and dead) mixtape-sharing website *muxtape* with it, called *duxtape* [(github)](https://github.com/kickscondor/duxtape).

  Suffice it to say, I am *very* interested.

## Articles

- [You (probably) don't need ReCAPTCHA](https://kevv.net/you-probably-dont-need-recaptcha/)

  TL;DR: (probably) yes

  I myself quite liked the proof-of-work captcha concept (i.e. "mine some hashes for me if you want to comment; if you want to spam a lot, it's ok, just mine a lot of hashes")

- [What is ZIL anyway?](http://blog.zarfhome.com/2019/04/what-is-zil-anyway.html)

  TL;DR: Andrew Plotkin on the [Infocom ZIP dump](https://github.com/historicalsource/), with an addendum by Tim Anderson

- [Circle Games](https://srconstantin.wordpress.com/2019/06/06/circle-games/)

  TL;DR: why babies like repetitive games like peek-a-boo, and how repetition be perceived as both boring or rewarding depending on context

## Music

- [Jozef Van Wissem & Jim Jarmusch - An Attempt to Draw Aside the Veil](https://jozefandjim.bandcamp.com/album/an-attempt-to-draw-aside-the-veil)

  An album of nice psychedelic drones, sometimes with acoustic guitar, and generally with certain mescalinic deserty feel to them.

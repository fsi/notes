## Programming

- Water is still wet. In other news, wordpress plugin ecosystem is still ~~trash~~ a ball of slimy writhing unspeakable horrors.

  - [one](https://www.jemjabella.co.uk/2019/security-alert-pipdig-insecure-ddosing-competitors/)
  - [two](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/03/peculiar-php-present-in-popular-pipdig-power-pack-plugin/)
  - [hackernews discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19538779)

  TL;DR: If you ever used anything from these "pipdig" guys on your wordpress or blogger site, please stop asap.

  I personally recommend switching to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead
  (do as I say, not as I do; you generally don't need the complexity of Gatsby).

- Just throwing it out there:
  [Disk encryption for low-end hardware](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/disk-encryption-low-end-hardware), Linux Journal

## Articles

- [Feynman on Fermat's Last Theorem](http://www.lbatalha.com/blog/feynman-on-fermats-last-theorem)

  TL;DR: Richard Feynman once proved that the probability of Fermat's Last Theorem to be true is less than 10{{<sup>}}–31{{</sup>}}% and concluded: "for my money Fermat’s theorem is true".

- [They Really Don’t Make Music Like They Used To](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/07/opinion/what-these-grammy-songs-tell-us-about-the-loudness-wars.html)

  TL;DR: "Loudness wars" history and analysis;
  and also why a release sometimes sounds way better on a vinyl record even though technically a CD has much wider dynamic range.
  (spoiler: it's usually sacrificed to make the album sound louder)

- [Astronomers hunting for the spy satellites](https://www.supercluster.com/editorial/meet-the-amateur-astronomers-hunting-for-spy-satellites)

## Music

- [Skyminds by Skyminds](https://auasca.bandcamp.com/album/skyminds) (available digitally and on cassette from *auasca*)

  Quite pleasant drone/ambient with some bluesy/desert rock kind of tunes.

  "Desert Winds" track reminds me of Fallout 2 a bit, so there's that.

## Art, also music

- [This is what it sounds like when you play all 265 Motorhead songs at the same time](https://www.loudersound.com/features/this-is-what-it-sounds-like-when-you-play-every-motorhead-song-at-once)

  TL;DL: Just as you imagine

## Games

- [TES Arena Remapped](https://www.nexusmods.com/tesarena/mods/1)

  This may sound like a custom maps set for TES: Arena, but it is not.

  In fact it's just a custom keyboard map for DosBOX to get modern WASD-style controls etc.

## Books

- Martian Time-Slip by Philip K. Dick

  Starts as silly Mars colonization sci-fi, ends up deep in scizophrenia and mindfuckery. Exactly what I like to read.

- How We'll Live on Mars by Stephen L. Petranek

  And for something (a bit) more realistic, here's this TED Book about future Mars colonisation (already dated, even though it was published in 2014 iirc).

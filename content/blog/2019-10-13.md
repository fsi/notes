## Programming

- [CollapseOS](https://collapseos.org/)

  TL;DR: Someone is making an 8-bit OS _just in case_ to be useful in _post-collapse scenarios_.

  > With a copy of this project, a capable and creative person should be able to manage to build and install Collapse OS without external resources (i.e. internet) on a machine of her design, built from scavenged parts with low-tech tools.

- [Don't Look Into The Light](https://christine.website/blog/dont-look-into-the-light-2019-10-06)

  TL;DR:

  > making something microservices out of the gate is a terrible idea

  Again, I can relate to this on _so many levels_

- [imagededup](https://idealo.github.io/imagededup/)

  A python tool to remove duplicates from a large collection of images.

  So **FINALLY** I can tidy up my "anime" and "wallpapers" folders!

  {{< small >}}(who am i kidding, they are the same folder){{</ small >}}

## Articles

- [The Web Can't Survive a Monoculture](http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2019/the-web-cant-survive-a-monoculture/)

  TL;DR: another anti-chrome ~~rant~~^W argument (and another one I agree with).

- [Common Kestrel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_kestrel)

  > This species is able to see near ultraviolet light, allowing the birds to detect the urine trails around rodent burrows as they shine in an ultraviolet colour in the sunlight

- [Ken Thompson's elusive Unix password is finally hacked](https://leahneukirchen.org/blog/archive/2019/10/ken-thompson-s-unix-password.html)

  ...and it's a chess move in descriptive notation.

- [Artifact: What Went Wrong?](https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2019/10/08/artifact-what-went-wrong/)

  Never played Artifact (nor Dota 2), and this article lists some reasons why (beyond being merely interesting).

## Art/Pictures

- [Nice cat paintings by Vanessa Stockard](https://www.instagram.com/vanessastockard/)

  Especially [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3YNQTsFlk9/), [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/B3L7BfCFZd6/), and [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/B0FMQLqlhzk/).

## Music

- [Doom:VS â€” Earthless](https://doomvs.bandcamp.com/album/earthless)

  Here's an album that I've listened to a while back, but gave it another go this week (now that I actually have it on an actual CD).

  What can I say, it is a very neat funeral doom album, sad, beautiful, powerful and sometimes overwhelming.

  My favorite quote is probably from the end of the album:

  > Now that you're gone<br />
  > Winter's come<br />
  > Please let me rise<br />
  > Please let me feel<br />

- [Sandbreaker - Sandbreaker EP](https://sandbreaker.bandcamp.com/)

  Given I'm still reading Dune and it's sequels, the timing on this EP couldn't be more perfect.

  It's a doom/death album that's clearly inspired by Dune, and is otherwise a regular doom/death thing.

## Games

- Finished [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/) on switch. Fun little game.

## Projects

- [First-Ever Audio Dataset of Malfunctioning Industrial Machines](https://medium.com/syncedreview/what-does-broken-sound-like-first-ever-audio-dataset-of-malfunctioning-industrial-machines-b4f8f6d81dd7)

  They say it's for machine learning, I say it's a sick sample pack

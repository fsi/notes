## Music

- [Тату - Нас не догонят Killed by Lazers remix](https://youtu.be/sCYUzHDw6PY)

  (the song also had an English version called Not Gonna Get Us)

- [16-武装翼の女神 - CATASTROPHIC OUTCOME OF PROGRESS](https://16awg16.bandcamp.com/album/catastrophic-outcome-of-progress-2)

  They're called "16ArmedWingedGoddess" and they play... cybergrind, I guess.
  With track titles and band name in Japanese, even though they are, as far as I am aware, American.

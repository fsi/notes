## Music

- [Wooden Shjips - Back to Land (2013)](https://woodenshjips.bandcamp.com/album/back-to-land)

  Hard psychedelic rock, very psychedelic in fact. Highly recommended.

  And as for something completely different, here's a communist-themed black metal.

## Art

- [Public domain release from the Cleveland Museum of Arts](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/highlights-from-the-cleveland-museum-of-arts-release-of-more-than-30k-images/), some are pretty nice

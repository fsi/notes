## Programming

- [The Best Refactoring You've Never Heard Of](http://www.pathsensitive.com/2019/07/the-best-refactoring-youve-never-heard.html)

  TL;DR: defunctionalize the continuation!

- [The PGP Problem](https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html)

  TL;DR: no solution in sight (just "use signal" is not a solution).

  Neat quote:

  > Take AEAD ciphers: the Rust-language Sequoia PGP defaulted to the AES-EAX AEAD mode, which is great, and nobody can read those messages because most PGP installs donâ€™t know what EAX mode is, which is not great

- [Web Rendering Proxy](https://github.com/tenox7/wrp), [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbd9qEzU5Q)

  An idea so horrible it works: this makes modern websites work on almost any browser (e.g. IE 1.5, of all things) by rendering them server-side and providing the browser with a GIF `ismap` image.

## Articles

- [Why did we wait so long for the bicycle?](https://rootsofprogress.org/why-did-we-wait-so-long-for-the-bicycle)

  Some nice pictures of early bicycles, tricycles and unicycles there.

- [A material way to make Mars habitable](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2019/07/material-way-to-make-mars-habitable)

  TL;DR: silica gel greenhouses; this approach is localized, and thus way more achievable than the global terraforming projects

- [Book bound in human skin](https://twitter.com/JayHulmePoet/status/1151102237302820864) [(threadreader)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1151102237302820864.html) [(archive link)](https://archive.fo/yj3ah)

- [Supernester](http://www.bldgblog.com/2019/06/supernester/)

  TL;DR: due to global warming, the wasps have started to build so called *super nests* which look as creepy as you'd imagine.

## Music

- [5 Composers, 1 Theme (youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWDITMZW1XE)

  This just kind of appeared in my recommendations, and I was not disappointed. 5 composers were asked to orchestrate a (somewhat silly) theme for a given orchestra. The results are quite different, and I liked them all.

- [Agnar - Summer Insomnia](https://strudelsoft.bandcamp.com/album/summer-insomnia)

  Speaking of floppycasts, here's a floppy album! In fact, a whole label of these `._.`

  (I happen to have one floppy music album myself, it's a split disk by two local grindcore bands, with total playtime of 36 seconds)

## Books

- [Through the First Antarctic Night by Frederick Albert Cook (1900)](https://archive.org/details/throughfirstan00cook) (via [public domain review](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/through-the-first-antarctic-night-1900/))

  Not that I'm gonna read this, but at least I enjoyed the article

- [Jo Marchant - Decoding the Heavens (2009)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5456216-decoding-the-heavens)

  And for something a bit different, here's a book that I just read. It was quite a fun read, although there could probably be a bit more mechanic and engineering parts. Still, it is very brief and easy read on the history of decoding of the ancient Greek Antikythera Mechanism, and I have enjoyed it a lot.

  (NB: goodreads link is for the English version, while I was reading the Russian translation)

## Art

- [Medieval snails](https://twitter.com/erik_kaars/status/1151409334666125312) [(threadreader)](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1151409334666125312.html)

- [Retro computers papercraft](http://rockybergen.com/papercraft)

  These are cute!

  Also, [here's my cruddy attempt at putting one of these together](https://i.imgur.com/btqPhhU.jpg). I may have folded the C64 part wrong, bite me.

Hello and welcome to my _personal space_, where I will probably post random links for, like, two people to notice.

I made it using [gatsby.js](https://gatsbyjs.org), and the experience was OK.
In retrospect I think I should've used some better starter, and not try and bend the default one to my will.
Oh well.

This whole thing seems to be working, so yay.

Here's a list of things that I still have to do at some point:

- **The [posts](/posts) page** currently shows a list of all posts.
  This is fine **for now**, but surely in some distant future there will be more than, say, 10 posts and it'll require some sort of pagination.
- **The CV**: I just copied it from the old version of this site without much retouching.
  Who cares, I'll update it when I need to :/
- I should probably make a list of my pet projects?
  Except my old garbage games, who needs those.

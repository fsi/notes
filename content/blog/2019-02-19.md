In this post, I will try and gather some interesting stuff I found around the internets.

- [Event sourcing is hard](https://chriskiehl.com/article/event-sourcing-is-hard).
  I used to work on an large product which was based on event-sourcing, and can agree on many points made by the author.
  It was very fun, but also a lot of pain.

  I guess, _eventually_, when the right tooling will be _sourced_, it will be usable...
  (Apache Kafka/Zamza come to mind; then again, it were these exact things that made us consider event-sourcing in the first place)

- [Anguish](https://www.rarenoiserecords.com/anguish) from rare noise records, an experimental mix of hip-hop and dark jazz improvisations.

- [The Prefect](https://www.amazon.com/Prefect-Revelation-Space-Book-ebook/dp/B0015DYJY4/) by Alastair Reynolds.
  Also a mix, but of hard sci-fi and murder mystery.
  Technically this book is in the same universe as his Revelation Space trilogy, but it's quite separate and reading other books is not required.

- [The Long History of the Mind-Bending ‘Tiny Planet’ Panorama](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-history-of-tinyplanet-and-panoramas), from Atlas Obscura

The only non-post update to this site is I've changed the "background" color in its manifest to my "brand" color, that is, `#da5f51`.

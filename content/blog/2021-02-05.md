It's been a while, eh.

So I've been [journaling](https://bulletjournal.com). So far it's been quite useful. Like a crutch, it helps me forget... less.

I've also been playing/reading visual noves from the Science Adventure series: so far I'm done with Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate, and on my way throught Robotics;Notes.
As re-reading the same text for the nth time is quite boring, and the auto-skip feature in the latter seems to be broken (as in, skips not only the text I've already read, but **EVERYTHING**), the [guide](http://sonome.dareno.me/projects/rne-walkthrough.html) from Committee of Zero has been very useful.

The "smart speaker" project is in a permanent working prototype stage at the moment. As in, it works, but instead of being neatly confined in a single case, it's currently unneatly rat's-nested together.
Still, it chills in the corner and plays nujabes from a network share, so what else would I want?

Upgraded my NAS to two 12TB drives (upward from two 4TB ones) in what I called a Theseus's RAID-1 manuever. (As RAID-1 is resilient against losing a single drive, you can replace one, then repair the RAID, then replace another drive, then enlarge the partition). "Using worst-case scenario", as a friend said. Anyway, this took about a day but it's all fine now!

And now, for some articles I've found interesting in the meantime:

- [The Glasgow cable car subway](http://www.cable-car-guy.com/html/ccgds.html) - just neat.
- [Why I'm Losing Faith in UX, by Mark Hurst](http://creativegood.com/blog/21/losing-faith-in-ux.html) - UX as in "User eXperience" has been mutated into UX as in "User eXploitation"
- [How Management by Metrics Leads Us Astray, by Jacob Greenfeld](https://jakobgreenfeld.com/metrics) - "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure".
  Something anyone should know and avoid ruling by metrics alone. What to do? Talk to people.
- [wiby.org](https://wiby.org/) â€” "oldschool web search". Added a couple of pages from here to their crawler.

Music:

- [Ebi - Zen](https://youtu.be/td6yY7_zdE8). Even a CD of this album is, like, $80+ on discogs.

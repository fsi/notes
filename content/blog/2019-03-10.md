## Programming

- [Wave Function Collapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse)

  An algorihtm that generates bitmaps that are locally similar to the input bitmap.

  Can be used for e.g. texture or dungeon generation.

  NB: Has nothing quantum or wave-functiony in it.

- [3d City generator](https://marian42.itch.io/wfc) that uses it

## Articles

- Speaking of quantum theory, [Quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05739-8)

  Turns out, we'd need some new theory to describe both microscopic and macroscopic events `._.`

## Games

- [Diablo 1 is on GOG!](https://www.gog.com/game/diablo)

  I wonder if GOG's version includes [this patch](http://www.strangebytes.com/index.php/projects/1-diablo-1-windows-7-vista-patch) or merely a similar one.

## Music

- [Sulphur Aeon - The Scythe of Cosmic Chaos](https://sulphuraeon-vanrecords.bandcamp.com/album/the-scythe-of-cosmic-chaos)

  Technical death metal in the vein of Nile, but 100% lovecraftian in theme.

- [Celtic Frost - Monotheist](https://www.amazon.com/Celtic-Frost-Monotheist-Japan-VICP-65115/dp/B009W67NB2/)

  To me, this is easily Celtic Frost's best album (they later continued under the name Triptykon).

  Bought it on a CD a couple of weeks ago and can't be happier!

  (the link is to a slightly different Japanese release)

## Art (?)

- [Very weird apartment for rent in Kyiv](http://archive.is/AP5yr) (archived page, not sure if works)

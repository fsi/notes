- [How to balance full-time work with creative projects](https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-balance-full-time-work-with-creative-projects/)

  TL;DR: Find a better job, don't think you'll be able to do a lot anyway

  Wombats are great, I totally understand them :D

- Mortal Kombat X, or XL, or whatever.

  It was cheap on Steam, so I got it, and now have mixed feelings about it.

  On one hand, there's more things in it, like, characters and moves and fatalities (if you get the XL version, that is).

  On the other hand, the single-player story mode is way too short (took me 5 hours on medium difficulty), and the "towers" mode is way too stingy with the in-game currency by comparison, so it'll take a lot of grinding to unlock all the unlocks (which can also be "conveniently" unlocked via a microtransaction. Ugh)

## Books

- [A long list of Weird Fiction books on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/16961.Best_Weird_Fiction_Books)

## Music

- [The Love Dimension - Dream Decibels](https://thelovedimension.bandcamp.com/album/dream-decibels)

  No exceptionally good albums this week, but have this very decent psychedelic rock LP that I've discovered at the last minute

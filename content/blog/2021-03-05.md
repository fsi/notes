## Life stuff

Lotsa things happened in February.

- Completed Robotics;Notes (would you like it? Probably, but I'd start with Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate)
- Bought an USB switch thingie to quickly switch keyboard from work PC to home PC. Now I wish I bought an HDMI one as well; this is very convenient.
  They don't seem to make HDMI switches that'd switch 4k60 content (most ones that say "4K" very prominently also have "30Hz" somewhere in fine print), but my second monitor is 1080p, so that's not a problem.
- Watched [The Kid Detective](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8980602/)
- Installed TiddlyWiki backend on my NAS. Might help with this blog; or, alternatively, might be forgotten within a week. Who knows.
- Completed [Learn Assembly Language by Making Games for the Atari 2600](https://www.udemy.com/course/programming-games-for-the-atari-2600/) course on Udemy (it was on sale in December, so I bought it).
  More beginner-oriented than what I'd need, but still piqued my interest.
  As in made me want to make an Atari 2600 game sometime in the near future.

...and this time the post is small-ish (and a week delayed) because I suddenly got sick (well, not suddenly, it was all because I spent a night at that The Comet is Coming concert, probably) and just started to return to the rhythm of things.

## Programming

- [POS software written in QBasic](http://keyhut.com/pos.htm), used worldwide

## Articles

- [The Termination Risks of Simulation Science](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56d45b30f699bb6f0beeaf5a/t/5d414831771f1c00012a3a0f/1564559413369/Termination+Risks+Submission.pdf)

  TL;DR: a scientist argues that it's quite unreasanable to expect the beings running our universe's simulation (if it indeed is one) to stop simulating it just because we've found out it is a simulation.
  They probably have better things to do.

  Also, they probably read articles like this one and would've done something already.

## Art/Pictures

- [London's Subterranean Victorian Bathrooms Now House Bars and Caf√©s](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/unusual-london-bars)

- [The first trillion-transistor chip](https://www.sigarch.org/the-first-trillion-transistor-chip-a-new-design-space/)

  TL;DR: too big to be called a chip. Massive, thick, heavy, and far too rough. Indeed, it is just a large hunk of silicon.

## Music

- [Idris Ackamoor & The Pyramids - An Angel Fell](https://idrisackamoorandthepyramids.bandcamp.com/)

  "Cosmic Jazz", very relaxed and psychedelic.

## Projects

- [Folding paper globes](https://mapscaping.com/pages/folding-paper-globes)

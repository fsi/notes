## Programming

- [No, PHP doesn't have closures](https://nullprogram.com/blog/2019/09/25/)

## Articles

- [WeWork and Counterfeit Capitalism](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/wework-and-counterfeit-capitalism)

- [What if Planet 9 is a Primordial Black Hole?](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11090v1)

  What killed me was the "exact scale illustration of a 5 Earth mass black hole"

- [The Octopus: An Alien Among Us](https://lithub.com/the-octopus-an-alien-among-us/)

  Clickbaity quote:

  > Yes, an octopus is objectively aware of itself and of the objects around it. It contains the information.

  ...but is it aware _subjectively_?! Who knows! I'm not an octopus!

- Also in the same vein, [The Intelligence of Plants](https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/09/26/the-intelligence-of-plants/) from the Paris Review

  TL;DR: Plants are intelligent in a way every living thing is

## Art/Pictures

- [Abandoned Japanese village](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7255885/Explorer-uncovers-abandoned-Japanese-village-houses-temples-given-way-trees.html)

  TW: Daily Mail

## Music

- [Here Lies Necrophagia](https://necrophagia.bandcamp.com/album/here-lies-necrophagia-35-years-of-death-metal)

  A compilation of their best songs. On CD and vinyl, with an optional t-shirt.
  Feels sad that this has to be their last album...

- And on a less sad note, [Mars Red Sky - The Task Eternal](https://www.shop-listenable.net/en/cd-/9149-mars-red-sky-the-task-eternal-limited-edition-digisleeve-cd-preorder.html)
  â€” also on spotify, google play, apple music, and that weird russian pirate site

  A new album from Mars Red Sky. Get it while it's hot (unless you're in America where it's to be released later in October)

  [Have a listen to their best track](https://marsredsky.bandcamp.com/track/stranger) (it's from their first EP, and not from this album, and it's a cover anyway, but it's fucking great)

## Projects

- [Mini mellotron made out of cassette Walkman](http://gieskes.nl/instruments/?file=zachtkind#p1)

  TL;DR: **HOLY SHIT I WANT ONE NOW**

- Also from the same author, [Analog Hard Drive](http://gieskes.nl/instruments/?file=analog-HD#p1), a kit that turns your old broken hard drive into a weird musical instrument.

- And lastly, here's the [Adventuron Halloween Jam](https://itch.io/jam/adventuron-halloween-jam) on itch.io and...

- ...a [pack of zx spectrum fonts from it](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/)

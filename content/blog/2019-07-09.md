## Programming

- [Live coding a vi for CP/M, from scratch](http://cowlark.com/2019-06-28-cpm-vi/)

- Somewhat related (and ancient), [Linux on an 8-bit micro](https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit)
  by emulating an ARM processor, no less! (slower than molasses, obviously, like, literally, hours to boot)

- Also related, [Why 80s BASIC still matters!](https://blog.usejournal.com/why-80s-basic-still-matters-1c17de5768fa) - this made me want to buy the book, and I probably will.

## Articles

- [Inside the World's First Long-term Storage Facility for Highly Radioactive Nuclear Waste](https://psmag.com/ideas/the-hiding-place-inside-the-worlds-first-long-term-storage-facility-for-highly-radioactive-nuclear-waste)

  Some nice photos there.

- [Why torture doesn't work](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/we-rsquo-ve-known-for-400-years-that-torture-doesn-rsquo-t-work/)

  Quite an obvious one, in retrospect; still, horrible how many people get this wrong to this day.

- [Loos, Lewdness, and Literature: Tales from the Boghouse](https://publicdomainreview.org/2019/04/17/tales-from-the-boghouse/)

  TL;DR: a review of an 18th century anthology of toilet poetry. Quite brave for the time!

- [Space station mold can survive a lot of radiation](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/space-station-mold-survives-200-times-radiation-dose-would-kill-human)

  Oh well, and there goes Gerard O'Neill's suggestion to sterilize everything that goes to space cylinder colonies to avoid dangerous bacteria and organisms. *Life, uh, finds a way*, so to say.

- [Don't Hire Assholes](https://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2019/06/03/dont-hire-assholes/)

  TL;DR: there's also ways to un-asshole some assholes

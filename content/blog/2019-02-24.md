## Programming

- [C is Not a Low-level Language](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3212479)

  All programming languages are abstractions, in some way.
  Even simplistic ones, like C and x86 assembly, are now quite far from the bare bones of the hardware (at least, in the x86-world) -- there's just too many layers of intermediate translations and optimizations that the CPU does by itself.

  RISC architectures are better in that regard, as even x86 CPUs are RISC-like internally nowadays (or so they say), so at least it's more transparent that way.

  Then again, as merely a front-end guy, I'm probably not the one to talk.
  Read the article instead.

## Music

- **Necrophobic - Mark of the Necrogram** ([spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/1qQg28aoo5RjtdcYBba0T2), [amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Mark-Necrogram-Standard-CD-Jewelcase/dp/B0787GMCDR)), a fast and furious black/death metal (as one may deduce from the band name, album title and the cover art).

  Highlights: easily Tsar-Bomba.

  Seen them perform live, also bought the CD.

## Art

As for art, here's two depressive japanese artists on twitter:

## Books

- [Land of the Lustrous](https://kodanshacomics.com/series/land-of-the-lustrous/), a manga series that is qiute stylishly drawn.

  I got the first five volumes of it DRM-free in a humble bundle, but I'm not sure if that's currently an option.

    (Not that any of my two or so readers would have any troubles finding it DRM-free guerilla-style, if you know what I mean)

## Technical updates

- The CSS should now follow the browser's preferred theme (light or dark).
  I'm not sure how it works, so whether if it does or not, please let me know.

## Articles

- [Exfiltrating information using the light sensor](https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/stealing-sensitive-browser-data-with-the-w3c-ambient-light-sensor-api/)

  Might not sound like much, but they mean, like, in a browser context. From JavaScript.

- [Why Renaissance Paintings Aren't as Green as They Used to Be](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/renaissance-verdigris-green-pigment)

  TL;DR: the green pigment they used is getting less green with time.

- [Nonviolent communication](https://www.clearerthinking.org/single-post/2019/03/06/Want-to-improve-your-relationships-Try-Nonviolent-Communication-1)

  A neat idea, should probably give the book a go.

  There's also a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNVcESwoWu4lI9C3bhkYIWB8-dphbzJ3)

## Books

- [Subtle art of not giving a fuck](https://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck)

  It's a nice book. Kind of. Made me feel better.

## Art/Pictures

- [Persian Demons](https://publicdomainreview.org/collections/persian-demons-from-a-book-of-magic-and-astrology-1921/)

  I like how [this](https://publicdomainreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/persian_astrology_00031.jpeg)
  and [this](https://publicdomainreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/persian_astrology_00035.jpeg)
  are totally things my cat actually does.

## Music

- [Entrails - Rise of the Reaper](https://entrails666.bandcamp.com/album/rise-of-the-reaper)

  A Swedish death metal record that kicks ass, with dense HM-2 sound and whatever else you might expect.

  Favorite track is probably "Cathedral of Pain".

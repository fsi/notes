## Programming

- [1991: A SERVER-SIDE WEB FRAMEWORK WRITTEN IN FORTH](http://www.1-9-9-1.com/), [github](https://github.com/urlysses/1991)

  BECAUSE OF COURSE

## Articles

- [Don't take notes with a laptop](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/)

  TL;DR: This has been told again and again, but hand-writing lecture notes makes you remember them better (and makes your hands hurt a lot)

- [Floppycasts!](http://ajroach42.com/floppycasts-1-44mb-podcasts/)

  TL;DR: if satisfied with [absolutely terrifying quality](http://ajroach42.com/floppycast-examples/), you can fit about 22 minutes of MP3 speech on a floppy disk, or about 30 minutes of Opus (approximately as terrifying but in a different way)

  I might've done something like this if I wasn't so ashamed of my own voice.

- [Life is fractal, but markets are square](https://invertedpassion.com/life-is-fractal-markets-are-square/) â€” very insightful

## Music

- [Tapage & Gareth Davis - STATES (bandcamp)](https://movingfurniturerecords.bandcamp.com/album/states)

  This is some music produced by an *electronic setup* that is allowed to self-influence and produce music until it reaches some stable state.

  There's also a sax player providing some atmosphere.

## Games

- [The Crimson Diamond](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1098770/The_Crimson_Diamond/)

  A text-parser adventure game in a quite fitting EGA graphics style.
  The free demo can be rough around the edges, but I hope the game will be finished some day.

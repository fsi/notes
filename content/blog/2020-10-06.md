title: Migrated to Hugo

This is something I've wanted to do for a long time (11 months? omg), but here it is at last. This site/blog is now powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I tried to keep stuff similar to how it was before, while adding my own _flair_.

The feed URL has been changed. I guess you know that if you're reading this, but make sure to update your RSS reader otherwise.

Also, as the sources for this site is now in plain markdown, I've merged them with my (previously private) [notes](https://github.com/fsi/notes/), so now you can enjoy such masterpieces as my [meat marinades]({{< ref "random/meat-marinades.md" >}}) and [add-srt-to-mp4]({{< ref "random/add-srt-to-mp4.md" >}}).

That's pretty much it. I took a week-long vacation off work and am spending it on stuff that's eerily similar to my actual work. Again.

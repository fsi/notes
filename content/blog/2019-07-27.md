First off, some updates:

- I've removed the Google Fonts dependency. Uses a couple of self-hosted fonts with system fallback now.
- Small visual updates as well.

Now on to business as usual.

## Programming

- [The Mutable Web](https://simulacrum.party/posts/the-mutable-web/), via hackernews

- [SVG PORN](https://svgporn.com/)

  NB: not actually porn, just a collection of hand-crafted SVG icons

  (via [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20504118))

- [Dungeon Generation in Diablo 1](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2019/07/14/dungeon-generation-in-diablo-1/)

  TL;DR: some were heavily inspired by Rogue and the likes. To the point of generating the layout in ASCII as one step.

  > When in doubt, glue more rectangles onto the side of things.

## Articles

- [Stone Age "consistent doodles"](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23230990-700-in-search-of-the-very-first-coded-symbols/)

  I.e. _writing-but-not-really_. I too have some "consistent doodles" of my own.

- [Why Communism is Useless](https://lparchive.org/Civilization-2/Update%2022/)

  That is, in the context of Sid Meier's Civilization 2, not in general.

- [Multi-layer Dictionaries](http://learnthesewordsfirst.com/about/what-is-a-multi-layer-dictionary.html)

  ALSO via [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20504208)

  Fun quote:

  > In 2011, a biologist named Michael Eisen found out, from one of his students, that the least-expensive copy of an otherwise unremarkable used book—“The Making of a Fly: The Genetics of Animal Design”—was available on Amazon for $1.7 million, plus $3.99 shipping. The second-cheapest copy cost $2.1 million. [...] Seller A’s price was consistently 99.83 per cent that of Seller B; Seller B’s price was reset, every day, to 127.059 per cent of Seller A’s. [...] Each seller’s presumed strategy was rational. It was the interaction of their algorithms that produced irrational results.

- [Quantum Darwinism](https://www.quantamagazine.org/quantum-darwinism-an-idea-to-explain-objective-reality-passes-first-tests-20190722/)

  Take that, Shcrödinger's Cat!

## Art

- [An interview with Junji Ito](https://grapee.jp/en/116016)

- [Il Disinganno](https://mymodernmet.com/francesco-queirolo-the-release-from-deception/)

  From the "holy fuck this is all marble" series. Probably via [francesco](https://ariis.it), but I'm not sure.

- [Ancient Greek marble sculpture half-eaten by the sea](http://blogs.nature.com/aviewfromthebridge/2015/09/29/beyond-the-antikythera-mechanism/)

  Also, speaking of marble and the Antikythera book, here's another photo by the author of the latter (along with some article). It's a marble sculpture (from the same shipwreck) of a boy wrestler that was half buried in the sand and therefore half-decomposed.

  The decomposed half is quite creepy in my opinion, but even creepier is the combination of two.

## Books

- [Game Engine Black Book: DOOM](http://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/)

  Buy it, read it.

## Music

- [The Devil and the Almighty Blues - Tre](https://thedevilandthealmightyblues.bandcamp.com/album/tre)

  Their first album had no title, their second album was called simply "II", and this is their third.

  Nice slow heavy psychedelic rock and blues tunes, quite enjoyed it.

- And for something completely different, here's an archive of [102 K-Mart background music tapes](https://archive.org/details/attentionkmartshoppers)

  This is also music, I guess.

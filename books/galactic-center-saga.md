# Galactic Center Saga

The Galactic Center Saga is a series of books by author Gregory Benford detailing a galactic war between mechanical and biological life.

## Personal notes

Found about it in a post on scifi stackexchange post (OP asked to identify a book they've read in the early 1990s). The synopsis, as described by OP, made me interested in the whole series.

> Read this sometime in late 1980s / early 1990s. Survivors of a human vs. robots war are trekking across a barren landscape. They stop at an underground cavern, one of a network established by the human resistance. Only to discover that the food stores have been poisoned by the robots.

> To be clear, this isn't The Terminator albeit it clearly shares many similarities.

Here is the accepted answer:

> I think this could be Great Sky River by Gregory Benford.

> This is the 3rd novel in the authors Galactic Center Saga and was originally published in 1987, which fits nicely into the OP's timeframe in the question.

> Great Sky River is set some 30k+ years into a future where humanity has spread towards the Galactic Center, but met a mechanoid civilisation and subsequently lost a lot of technology as the mech's tried to wipe humanity out.

> > After the events of Across the Sea of Suns, small groups of humans have settled on other star systems. However, there is a constant threat from the Mechs, a civilization of machines left over from other civilizations and evolved to see all biological civilization as unstable and dangerous.
